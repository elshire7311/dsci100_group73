    "Heart disease is a broad term that refers to different heart conditions. Something in common is their effect on blood flow and dilation of veins to the heart. Other factors such as age, sex, and exercise are factors that are closely linked with heart disease. In our directory there are four data bases: Cleveland, Hungarian, Long Beach (California), and Switzerland. We decided to choose Long Beach due to similar culture (such as food and lifestyle) between Vancouver and Long beach. \n"

With this research, we hope to create a model that can predict (to a high level of accuracy) whether a person has heart disease. We will use data taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository's Heart Disease Dataset to train our model to predict whether someone has heart disease based on the 5 risk factors listed earlier. If our model is successful, it will be a great aid to the medical community by creating fast and easy diagnosis of heart disease in patients, and will allow doctors to quickly assist those in need. A doctor could simply input the measurements taken for each of the 5 risk factors and the model will determine whether the patient is developing heart disease or not. \n",
