Other factors such as age, sex, and exercise are factors that are closely linked with heart disease. In our directory there are four data bases being, Cleveland, Hungarian, Long Beach (California), and from switzerland. We decided to do choose Long Beach due to similar culture such as food and lifestyle between Vancouver and Long beach. \n"
